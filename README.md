# Ray-Tracing
Initial attempt at creating a ray tracing accelerator with an FPGA

This project contains all the supporting files. 
- FPGA contains the IP for the DDR3 RAM
- FPGA-HDL contains the FPGA code for the most up to date whitted raytracer
- Sphere Demo contains the renders from a proof of concept ray tracing algorithm made in C++
- VGA Buddy contains the PCB design for a DAC to drive VGA from the FPGA
- Whitted Proper contains an algorithm for ray tracing made in C++ as proof of concept
