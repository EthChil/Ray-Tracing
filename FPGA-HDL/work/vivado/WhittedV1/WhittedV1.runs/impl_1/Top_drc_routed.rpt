2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net RT/addr_out0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin RT/addr_out_reg[24]_i_1__0/O, cell RT/addr_out_reg[24]_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net arb_ram2vga/completeOut_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin arb_ram2vga/completeOut_reg/L3_2/O, cell arb_ram2vga/completeOut_reg/L3_2 (in arb_ram2vga/completeOut_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net arb_rt2ram/completeOut_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin arb_rt2ram/completeOut_reg/L3_2/O, cell arb_rt2ram/completeOut_reg/L3_2 (in arb_rt2ram/completeOut_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/requestOut0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/rd_out_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell ram/rd_out_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga/addr_out0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga/addr_out_reg[24]_i_1/O, cell vga/addr_out_reg[24]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal ram/mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the ram/mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of ram/mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
